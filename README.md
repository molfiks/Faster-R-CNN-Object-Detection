# Faster-R-CNN-Object-Detection

## Introduction

This repository contains my implementation of an object detection model using Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network). I created this project for learning purposes to explore how object detection works and gain hands-on experience with deep learning techniques.

## Project Structure
- `train.py`: Script for training the Faster R-CNN model on a custom dataset.
- `detect.py`: Script for running real-time object detection.


Customize the template by replacing placeholders (e.g., your-username, /path/to/dataset) with relevant information specific to your project. Good luck with your GitHub repository, and happy coding! 🚀👩‍💻
