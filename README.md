# Faster-R-CNN-Object-Detection

Overview
This repository contains my implementation of an object detection model using Faster R-CNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network). I created this project for learning purposes to explore how object detection works and gain hands-on experience with deep learning techniques.

Features
Fine-tuned Faster R-CNN model using PyTorch
Custom dataset (VOCDataset) for training
Real-time object detection using webcam feed
Evaluation metrics and performance analysis
Getting Started
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/object-detection-faster-rcnn.git

Install dependencies (PyTorch, torchvision, etc.).
Download your dataset or use a publicly available dataset (e.g., Pascal VOC).
Train the model:
python train.py --dataset /path/to/dataset

Run real-time object detection:
python detect.py --source 0
